This file just contains some scraps and miscellaneous notes about my blog site.

## Ideas to develop
Animation for the growth of the virtual campus
Present one or two AZ Assist reports
Tap more reports from EMSI

## I use the Hugo "Academic" theme

###### Data Files ######

For a blog post, the data file must be in the same directory as
the .Rmd file. Otherwise, the post will not build since it won't be
able to find the file.

For the tutorials, put the cafe data file in /static/data/ and
then link to that in the tutorial using a full URL. That works
since the file is not needed until the tutorial page is opened 
and it will be present in the directory by then.


## Framewidget

All htmlwidgets need to be wrapped in a framewidget.
Note: datatables seem to fit best with a pagelength of 7

library(widgetframe)
f1 <- datatable(names, options = list(pageLength = 7))
frameWidget(f1)


## Bar Plot Setup
ggplot(data = t, aes(x = name, y = tuition)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = tuition)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = t$name[order(-t$tuition)]) +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = 'orange', high = 'brown') +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Tuition Comparison", x = "College", y = "Tuition") +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Tuition")) +
  coord_flip()

## plotly 

Notes: do not put a plotly plot in a framewidget (it becomes very wide). 
Do not set an output width, let the system make it fit in the reading frame.

p <- ggplot(data = reg02, aes(x = Tuition, y = Hispanic)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Percent of Hispanic Students vs Tuition", 
       x = "Tuition/student/year", 
       y = "Percent of Hispanic Students") +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')

ggplotly(p)

## HTMLWIDGETS

(see htmlwidgets.org)

## Kable

df %>%
  kable("html", align = c("l","r","r","r","r","r","r","r")) %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",
                full_width = F,
                position = "center") %>%
    row_spec(row = 1, 
             bold = TRUE,
             color = "#FFFFFF",
             background = "#1e4d99")
