This file just contains some scraps and miscellaneous notes about my blog site.

## Ideas to develop
Animation for the growth of the virtual campus
Present one or two AZ Assist reports
Tap more reports from EMSI

## I use the Hugo "Ghostwriter" theme

###### Style Guide ######
The word *R* is italicized.
*R* commands are set off by single back-ticks: `str(cafe)`
Data frame names and variables are italicized 
"Data frame" is two words, not one
To create MathJax input: 
\[...\] for a block
\(...\) for inline

###### GIT Notes ######

Open the GIT shell
Navigate to the GIT directory of interest on the e:/ drive

cd /e/GitHub/gself
git add *
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin master

Note: you'll get a lot of warnings about line endings. 
As the files are uploaded the line ending are changed 
to CRLF (Unix-style) rather than just CR (Windows-style). 
That doesn't seem to hurt anything.


###### Data Files ######

For a blog post, the data file must be in the same directory as
the .Rmd file. Otherwise, the post will not build since it won't be
able to find the file.

For simpler posts, I create a data frame for each post rather than
use a general data frame and process it with the post. Those data
frames are created at Google Drive/Web Source Files. When the 
data frame is ready it is copy/pasted into the icochise directory
and then used there.

For the tutorials, put the cafe data file in /static/data/ and
then link to that in the tutorial using the full URL. That works
since the file is not needed until the tutorial page is opened 
and the data directory will be built by then.


###### R Tools  ######

## Bar Plot Setup

ggplot(data = t, aes(x = name, y = tuition)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = tuition)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = t$name[order(-t$tuition)]) +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = 'orange', high = 'brown') +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Tuition Comparison", x = "College", y = "Tuition") +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Tuition")) +
  coord_flip()


## plotly 

Notes: do not put a plotly plot in a framewidget (it becomes very wide). 
Do not set an output width, let the system make it fit in the reading frame.

p <- ggplot(data = reg02, aes(x = Tuition, y = Hispanic)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Percent of Hispanic Students vs Tuition", 
       x = "Tuition/student/year", 
       y = "Percent of Hispanic Students") +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')

ggplotly(p)


## Framewidget

All htmlwidgets (see next) need to be wrapped in a framewidget.
Note: datatables seem to fit best with a pagelength of 7

library(widgetframe)
f1 <- datatable(names, options = list(pageLength = 7))
frameWidget(f1)


## HTMLWIDGETS

(see htmlwidgets.org)


## Kable

df %>%
  kable("html", align = c("l","r","r","r","r","r","r","r")) %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",
                full_width = F,
                position = "center") %>%
    row_spec(row = 1, 
             bold = TRUE,
             color = "#FFFFFF",
             background = "#1e4d99")
