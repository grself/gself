###### Style Guide ######
The word *R* is italicized.
*R* commands are set off by single back-ticks: `str(cafe)`
Data frame names and variables are italicized 
"Data frame" is two words, not one



###### Data Files ######

For a blog post, the data file must be in the same directory as
the .Rmd file. Otherwise, the post will not build since it won't be
able to find the file.

For the tutorials, put the cafe data file in /static/data/ and
then link to that in the tutorial using the full URL. That works
since the file is not needed until the tutorial page is opened 
and it will be present in the directory by then.


###### R Tools  ######


## Bar Plot Setup

ggplot(data = t, aes(x = name, y = tuition)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = tuition)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = t$name[order(-t$tuition)]) +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = 'orange', high = 'brown') +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Tuition Comparison", x = "College", y = "Tuition") +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Tuition")) +
  coord_flip()


## plotly 

Notes: do not put a plotly plot in a framewidget (it becomes very wide). 
Do not set an output width, let the system make it fit in the reading frame.

p <- ggplot(data = reg02, aes(x = Tuition, y = Hispanic)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Percent of Hispanic Students vs Tuition", 
       x = "Tuition/student/year", 
       y = "Percent of Hispanic Students") +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')

ggplotly(p)


## Framewidget

All htmlwidgets (see next) need to be wrapped in a framewidget.
Note: datatables seem to fit best with a pagelength of 7

library(widgetframe)
f1 <- datatable(names, options = list(pageLength = 7))
frameWidget(f1)


## HTMLWIDGETS

(see htmlwidgets.org)


## Kable

df %>%
  kable("html", align = c("l","r","r","r","r","r","r","r")) %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",
                full_width = F,
                position = "center") %>%
    row_spec(row = 1, 
             bold = TRUE,
             color = "#FFFFFF",
             background = "#1e4d99")


###### GIT Notes ######

Open the GIT shell
Navigate to the GIT directory of interest on the e:/ drive

cd /e/GitHub/gself
git add *
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin master

Note: you'll get a lot of warnings about line endings. As the files are uploaded the line ending are changed to CRLF (Unix-style) rather than just CR (Windows-style). That doesn't seem to hurt anything.
