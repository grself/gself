      <description>I recently found an interesting tutorial on how to use ggplot2 in R to create pretty graphs. The key is to define a mathematical function that plots points in some sort of pattern and then use various ggplot2 features to make that plot look nice. Find the tutorial at this link.
The tutorial used the concept of phyllotaxis to create interesting scatter plots. Phyllotaxis is the spiral arrangement of the leaves on a stem and that arrangement can be simulated with a bit of mathematics.</description>
