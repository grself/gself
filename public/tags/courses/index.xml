      <description>Cochise College uses Moodle as our online learning platform and this post presents some interesting statistics from our Moodle system.
By policy, all students at Cochise College are automatically entered into the Moodle system, even if they are not taking an online class. By doing that, instructors in face-to-face classes can use the Moodle system to post their syllabi, reading material, and other information of interest to the class. As of today, we have 57,719 users in the Moodle system but only 21,740 are currently active so the others were created over the years and are no longer in an active class.</description>

      <description>The following table is a completion report for Cochise College where various programs are linked to a job analysis. For example, in the field of education, we had 23 completers in 2003 and 147 in 2017, for a 539% increase. There were 372 annual openings at a median hourly salary of $18.21. To be sure, most education jobs require degrees higher than an Associate’s, but this information is at least an indicator of the likelihood of success for our graduating students whether they continue to pursue an education degree or seek work as an education paraprofessional.</description>

      <description>For a number of years, Cochise College has subscribed to Intelliboard, an analytics engine for our Moodle online learning management system. Intelliboard has a ton (that’s a statistics term) of analytics available and I’m just now starting to look at some of the data to determine how we can leverage that for our decision-makers. As an example, here is a graph that shows the number of page hits on our Moodle system over a one-week period.</description>
