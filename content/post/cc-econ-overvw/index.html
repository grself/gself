<p>I produced an EMSI Economic Overview of Cochise County and attached the results below. This is a thorough 25-page report and includes information on Cochise Countyâ€™s population, cost of living, employment, Gross Regional Product, and many other interesting bits of economic information. You will enjoy reading this and can use it as a reference for projects that you may be working on.</p>
