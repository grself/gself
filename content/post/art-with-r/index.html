<p>I recently found an interesting tutorial on how to use <em>ggplot2</em> in R to create pretty graphs. The key is to define a mathematical function that plots points in some sort of pattern and then use various <em>ggplot2</em> features to make that plot look nice. Find the <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/projects/62">tutorial at this link</a>.</p>
<p>The tutorial used the concept of phyllotaxis to create interesting scatter plots. Phyllotaxis is the spiral arrangement of the leaves on a stem and that arrangement can be simulated with a bit of mathematics. Here are two plots I made using the phyllotaxis concept.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

# Define the number of points
points &lt;- 1000

# Defining the angle between each point
# The &#39;Golden Angle&#39; is found in nature, about 2.4
#angle &lt;- pi*(3 - sqrt(5)) # About 2.4
angle &lt;- 3.5 # Tried various angles other than the Golden Angle

# Transparancy for the points (0-1.0)
ptAlpha &lt;- 0.25

# Shape of the points (see http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Shapes_and_line_types/)
ptShape &lt;- 19

# Set the background color
bgColor &lt;- &#39;lightyellow&#39;

# Create a df with the points to plot
t &lt;- (1:points) * angle
x &lt;- sin(t)
y &lt;-cos(t)
df &lt;- data.frame(t, x, y)

ggplot(df, aes(x*t, y*t)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = t), size = 10.0, alpha = ptAlpha, shape = ptShape) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = &#39;orangered1&#39;, high = &#39;gold2&#39;) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = bgColor),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        legend.position = &quot;none&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>The mathematics for these images was fairly simple and it took me longer to figure out all of the <em>ggplot2</em> settings needed to make the plots look nice without all of the analysis trappings (like gridlines). I had a couple of hours of fun creating this post — now, back to work…</p>
