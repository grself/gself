## About

I'm more than 60 years old but am not retired. I have been an elementary school teacher, an EMT, an electronics technician, and am currently a Dean at a community college. I also teach college classes in digital logic, research, and technical communication. Five Cocker Spaniels own me and my wife and on weekends I change into “Parson George” to lead ghost tours in nearby Tombstone, Arizona.
